# Feature Scaling Toolkit 📏🔧

Welcome to the **Feature Scaling Toolkit**! This repository provides essential tools and techniques for scaling and normalizing features in your datasets, ensuring they are optimized for machine learning models.

## Features ✨

- **Standardization**: Scale features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Normalization**: Adjust features to a specific range, such as [0, 1].
- **Robust Scaling**: Scale features using statistics that are robust to outliers.
- **Min-Max Scaling**: Transform features to fit within a specified range, typically [0, 1].

Happy coding and data prepping! 🚀
